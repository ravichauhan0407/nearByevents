# Nearby Events

Welcome to Nearby Events! This project allows users to view and add events happening in their area. It was built using React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, REST APIs, and the Antd CSS library.


## Features

- View upcoming, live, and archived events: Users can switch between different tabs to view events that are coming up, currently happening, or have already finished.
- Add new events to the list: Users can fill out a form to add their own events to the list, which will be displayed on the appropriate tab based on the event's start and end dates.
- Search for events: Users can use the search bar to filter the events by keyword.
